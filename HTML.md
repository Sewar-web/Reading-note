# HTML

*How the Web Works:
When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.*

**Components html**
1. head :This contains information
about the page
* it contains :
   - tilte :The contents of the title
element are either shown in the
top of the browser
  
  
2. body :Everything inside this element is
shown inside the main browser
window.


**forms**
* Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
form element**

* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

  **DOCTYPEs**
  Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).


*Comments in HTML*
If you want to add a comment
to your code use <!-- -->

*ID attribute : It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page*

instructions :

* Its value must begin with
A character or underscore (not
No. or any other character).

* It is important not to have two
Items on the same page
It has the same value for their identity
Adjectives (otherwise, value
It is no longer unique.)

 **CLASS Attribute**
 To do this you can use the
class attribute. Its value
should describe the class it
belongs to. In the example on
the left, key paragraphs have a
class attribute whose value is
important.
The class attribute on any
element can share the same
value. So, in this example, the
value of important could be
used on headings and link



3. div : allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.

4. span :element acts like
an inline equivalent of the div
element. 

It is used to either:
* Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable
element to differentiate it from
its surrounding text
* Contain a number of inline
elements

5. iframe : An iframe is like a little window
that has been cut into your
page — and in that window you
can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.

* src
The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the

frame.
* height
The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.

* width
The width attribute specifies
the width of the iframe in pixels.

6. meta : The meta element lives
inside the head element and
contains information about that
web page.
It is not visible to users but
fulfills a number of purposes
such as telling search engines
about your page, who created
it, and whether or not it is time
sensitive. (If the page is time
sensitive, it can be set to expire.


**HTML5 Layout**
 HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

 * The header and footer
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
* A header or footer for an
individual article or
section within the page.

7. header :element used to contain the site
name and the main navigation.

8. footer :element contains
copyright information, along
with links to the privacy policy
and terms and conditions.


9. The nav : element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.


10. The : article : element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual
article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other
independent piece of content.


11. The aside: element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not.

12.  The section :element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
For example, on a homepage
there may be several section
elements to contain different
sections of the page, such as
latest news, top products, and
newsletter signup.



13. hgroup :The purpose of the hgroup
element is to group together a
set of one or more h1 through
h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.

***WireFrames***
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.


* Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being
displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.
