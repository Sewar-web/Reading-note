# Functions

* allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task

* can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.

  ***object  : is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.***
  
  1.  variables are known as properties of the
     object;
  2.  functions are known as methods of the object
   
    *Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window. *


**Data type of JavaScrip**
1. String
2. Number
3.  Math
4.   and Date


## COMPARISON OPERATORS: EVALUATING CONDITIONS

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.

1. == : This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same

2. !=  : This operator compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same
   

3. === : This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.

4. !== : This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not  the same.
   


   ## IF ,ELSE STATMENT 

   *if ,eLse statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false*

***note***
all the statment inside the if should be followed by  ;





### SWITCH STATEMENTS

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the
variable matches that value. 

the struct of switch :
switch () {
case ' ':
break;
case '':
break;
default :
break;
}


**comparison between **

IF ... ELSE                                                                 
• There is no need to provide an el se
option. (You can just use an if
statement.)
• With a series of if statements, they are
all checked even if a match has been found
(so it performs more slowly than switch).

AND 

SWITCH
• You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.
• If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements). 


* type coercion : JavaScript can convert data
types behind the scenes to
complete an operation

  

DATA TYPE    PURPOSE
string       Text
number       Number
Boolean      true or false
nul          Empty value
undefined     Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value


Logical operators:

1. and && : if i have one value  false then make the result  false .
2. or ||  :  if i have one value  true then make the result  true .
