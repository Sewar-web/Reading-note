# HTML-css

**Hypertext markup language, in Arabic, denotes that it refers to the creation of web pages, and you can refer to the creation of web pages and their infrastructure; You can reduce the value of details about how the siteâ€™s content is presented by dividing it into headings and paragraphs, all based on what are known as tags.**

*The tags*

 *As a tag that begins like this <> and ends like this </>
It should start with <html> and end with </html>*

*** As this is considered a major condition for embarking on building a web page that all the tags must be confined between these two tags ***

Among the tags included in any HTML web page are:

1. head
2. title 
3. body
 
   and so on
    
    ***
