***Causes of the problem:***

**1-obstacles**
When most people encounter obstacles, they escape from them, not solve them
2 Effort
Some people with an effort problem don't like exerting effort trying to escape 
But the right thing is to make the effort to feel comfortable

**2- Criticism**
Criticism is useful many times to review and improve behavior next time
Therefore, the best way is to ask yourself a question
1 What is the best thing I did today
2 What was the worst thing you did today

**3- Success of others**
In many cases, jealousy doesn't improve your condition, but loving being good about others is always beneficial
The success of others is also considered your success
Growth mindset. Encourages you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration
