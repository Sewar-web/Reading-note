# JAVASCRIPT 
 
 ***javascript allows you to make web page more interactive 
 by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in web page 
 while it is being viewed in the browers***


* You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. 
**example**
Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page


* modify content 
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them
like :
1. Add a paragraph
2. Change the value of c 1 ass
3. Change the size or position of an
img element

******

***PROGRAM RULES***
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser which allows it to access or change the
content of a page

like :
1. A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.

2. An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window

***REACT TO EVENTS***
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred.
 For example, it could be run when : 
1. A button is pressed
2. A link is clicked (or tapped) on
 ****

 
 example of javascript  :
1.  SLIDESHOWS :can display a number of different images
 within the same space .
* React: Script triggered when the page loads
* Access: Get each slide from the slideshow
* Modify: Only show the first slide (hide others)
* Program: Set a timer: when to show next slide
* Modify: Change which slide is shown
* React: When user clicks button for different slide
* Program: Determine which slide to show
* Modify: Show the requested slider

2. FILTERING DATA :if you have a lot of information you can help users find information they need 
* React: Script triggered when page loads
* Program: Collect keywords from images
* Program: Turn the keywords into buttons the user
can click on
* React: User clicks on one of the buttons
* Program: Find the relevant subset of images that
should be shown
* Modify: Show the subset of images that use that tag


## what is a script and how do i creat one 

***script*** :  script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
 
* To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it*

1. DEFINE THE GOAL :
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

2.  DESIGN THE SCRIPT :
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. 
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
1. CODE EACH STEP :
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight
away, it pays to spend time designing your script
before you start writing it. 


### RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES :
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number
 
2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases 

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age. 

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash). 

****

***array***

* array :is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.
You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.


* creating an array :
  you can creat array like this :
  var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O]; 

*Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list*

1. NUMBERING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY 
* Each item in an array is
automatically given a number
called an index

example:

INDEX  VALUE
0    'white '
1    'black'
2    'custom' 


2. ACCESSING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY : To retrieve the third item on the
list .
example :
var itemThr ee;
itemThree = col ors [2] ; 

3. NUMBER OF ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY .
Each array has a property called
length, which holds the number
of items in the array.  
example:
var numColors ;
numColors =col ors. length;
***

1. EXPRESSIONS :
 EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
example:
var color = 'beige'; 



When you first declare a variable using the var
keyword, it is given a special value of undefined.
This will change when you assign a value to it.
Technically, undefined is a data type like a number,
string, or Boolean

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 

example :var area = 3 * 2;
