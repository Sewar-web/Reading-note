# javascript
***javascript allows you to make web page more interactive 
 by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in web page 
 while it is being viewed in the browers***


* You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. 
**example**
Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page


* modify content 
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them
like :
1. Add a paragraph
2. Change the value of c 1 ass
3. Change the size or position of an
img element

******

***PROGRAM RULES***
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser which allows it to access or change the
content of a page

like :
1. A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.

2. An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window

***REACT TO EVENTS***
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred.
 For example, it could be run when : 
1. A button is pressed
2. A link is clicked (or tapped) on
 ****

 
 example of javascript  :
1.  SLIDESHOWS :can display a number of different images
 within the same space .
* React: Script triggered when the page loads
* Access: Get each slide from the slideshow
* Modify: Only show the first slide (hide others)
* Program: Set a timer: when to show next slide
* Modify: Change which slide is shown
* React: When user clicks button for different slide
* Program: Determine which slide to show
* Modify: Show the requested slider

2. FILTERING DATA :if you have a lot of information you can help users find information they need 
* React: Script triggered when page loads
* Program: Collect keywords from images
* Program: Turn the keywords into buttons the user
can click on
* React: User clicks on one of the buttons
* Program: Find the relevant subset of images that
should be shown
* Modify: Show the subset of images that use that tag

## what is a script and how do i creat one 

***script*** :  script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
 
* To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it*

1. DEFINE THE GOAL :
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the
computer to solve.

2.  DESIGN THE SCRIPT :
To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. 
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.
3. CODE EACH STEP :
Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
As tempting as it can be to start coding straight
away, it pays to spend time designing your script
before you start writing it.

**How do the computer fit into the world around them**

* OBJECTS (TH INGS)
In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object. There are
two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car.
Programmers might say that there is one instance of
the hotel object, and two instances of the car object.
Each object can have its own:
1.  Properties
2.  Events
3. Methods
Together they create a working model of that object.

* PROPERTIES : Each property has a name and a value, and each of
these name/value pairs tells you something about
each individual instance of the object.
The most obvious property of this hotel is its name.
The value for that property is Quay. 



* EVENT:
In the real world, people interact with objects. These interactions can
change the values of the properties in these objects
An event is the computer's way of sticking up its
hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!"

**WHAT DOES AN EVENT DO?
Programmers choose which events they respond to.
When a specific event happens, that event can be
used to trigger a specific section of the code.
Scripts often use different events to trigger different
types of functionality.
So a script will state which events the programmer
wants to respond to, and what part of the script
should be run when each of those events occur.**


* METHODS :Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties. 

  - WHAT IS A METHOD?
Methods typically represent how people (or other
things) interact with an object in the real world.
They are like questions and instructions that:
• Tell you something about that object (using
information stored in its properties)
• Change the value of one or more of that object's
properties 

  - WHAT DOES A METHOD DO?
The code for a method can contain lots of
instructions that together represent one task.
When you use a method, you do not always need to
know how it achieves its task; you just need to know
how to ask the question and how to interpret any
answers it gives you. 



* Web developers usually talk
about three languages that
are used to create web pages:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Where possible, aim to keep the
three languages in separate files,
with the HTML page linking to
CSS and JavaScript files.

* Each language forms a separate
layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right.
builds on the previous one

### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.

* This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.
