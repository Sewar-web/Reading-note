# color 
  **The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:**

1. rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

2. hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3. color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan
We look at these three different
ways of specifying colors on the
next double-page spread.

*** comments ***
* CSS allows you to add comments
to your CSS files. Anything
between the /* symbols and
the */ symbols will not be
interpreted by the browser

*  help you to understand a CSS file

*** 
## background-color

* You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways 
1. background-color: rgb(200,200,200);

2. background-color: DarkCyan
   
3. background-color: #ee3e80
   
*  defulat color :background-color: white 

*Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.*


 * pixels : Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares

* The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television screen.

* Color picking tools are available
in image editing programs like
Photoshop and GIMP. You can
see the RGB values specified
next to the radio buttons that
say R, G, B.

* The hex value is provided
next to the pound or hash
 symbol. There is also a
good color picking tool at:

1. RGB Values
Values for red, green, and blue
are expressed as numbers
between 0 and 255. 
rgb(102,205,170)
This color is made up of the
following values:
102 red
205 green
170 blue

2. Hex Codes
Hex values represent values
for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.
#66cdaa
The value of the red, 102, is
expressed as 66 in hexadecimal
code. The 205 of the green is
expressed as cd and the 170 of
the blue equates to aa.


3. Color Names
Colors are represented by
predefined names. However,
they are very limited in number.
MediumAquaMarine
There are 147 color names
supported by browsers (this
color is MediumAquaMarine).
Most consider this to be a
limited color palette, and it is
hard to remember the name for
each of the colors so (apart from
white and black) they are not
commonly used.


4. Hue
Hue is near to the colloquial idea
of color. Technically speaking
however, a color can also have
saturation and brightness as
well as hue.

5. Saturation
Saturation refers to the amount
of gray in a color. At maximum
saturation, there would be no
gray in the color. At minimum
saturation, the color would be
mostly gray.

6. Brightness
Brightness (or "value") refers
to how much black is in a color.
At maximum brightness, there
would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the
color would be very dark.


** When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible. **


* CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

1. hue
Hue is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360

2. saturation
Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.

3. lightness
Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.


example of color :

 background-color: rgb(84,182,237)

 background-color: rgb(48,170,233)

 background-color: #ffffff;

 background-color: hsla(0,100%,100%,0.5);

 ****
 * Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
  
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
