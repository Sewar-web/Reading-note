# MarkDown lets us create notes in a beautiful and easy way

 **for example**

*When I want a big font, I put # before the text
If you want to create a smaller font, put ##
And so on*

1. To make a bold font, put ** at the beginning and the end or -
2. To make the font in the Italian style, put * at the beginning and the end or -

3. To combine audacity with Italian, we put *** at the beginning and the end

4. To make an inclusive sentence, we put <

5. To form a group of sentences, we place them in front of them at the beginning and end


***To add a link, we put rectangular brackets [], we put the site name, then we open regular brackets and put the link extension ()***

- To make a list we put - or a number like 1, 2, etc.
    -  To make a nested list
          We put the number at the beginning and then go to a new line and put a space and so on
